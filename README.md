Currently, I'm learning GoLang. I love how simple yet powerful it is (just like C).
This is one of my most recent projects:
- **Messaging Service with End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Built a messaging service similar to email, where users can securely send messages to each other using x509 certificates. Source code [here](https://git.olympuslab.net/Uni/CSI-ES-2324/src/branch/main/Projs/PD1).

## Projects

## University Projects

During my time at university, I've worked on various projects that have helped me grow as a developer. Here are a few highlights:
- **Tech Finder Android App**: Created an Android app called Tech Finder for a university assignment. Explore the project [here](https://github.com/afonsofrancof/TechFinder).
- **Markdown to HTML Converter**: Built a converter tool to convert Markdown files to HTML as part of a university project. See the code [here](https://github.com/afonsofrancof/MD-2-HTML).
- **Messaging Service with End-to-End Encryption**: Implemented secure communication protocols to ensure privacy and confidentiality in messaging. See the code [here](https://git.olympuslab.net/Uni/CSI-ES-2324/src/branch/main/Projs/PD1)

Looking forward to collaborating and learning together!
