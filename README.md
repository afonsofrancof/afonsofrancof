# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Afonso, a software developer with a strong interest in cybersecurity and networking.

## Education ðŸŽ“
I hold a [Bachelor](https://web.di.uminho.pt/sitedi/enginf/) degree in Software Engineering and am currently pursuing my [Masters](https://web.di.uminho.pt/sitedi/meinf/) in **Formal Methods of Programming** and **Cybersecurity and Cryptography**.

## Career Aspirations
I aspire to work in roles where I can leverage my skills in code review and cybersecurity to contribute to the industry. Whether it's ensuring code quality, analyzing security vulnerabilities, or designing robust systems, I'm eager to make a meaningful impact.

## Interests
- **Cybersecurity**: With a keen interest in cybersecurity, I'm passionate about ensuring secure communication and data protection in all my projects.
- **Functional Programming**: I like how simplistic and effective haskell is.
- **Open Source Movement**: I deeply value the collaborative nature of the open source movement. Participating in open source projects not only fosters innovation but also strengthens security by allowing peer review and community contributions. Contributing to and benefiting from open source projects is about sharing knowledge, fostering innovation, and enhancing security through collective efforts.
- **Self Hosting**: Everything I can host myself.

## Technologies
- **Keyboard**: [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58)
- **Window Managers**: [XMonad](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad) and [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
- **OS**: [Arch Linux](https://github.com/archlinux) and [MacOS](https://github.com/apple)
- **Editor**: [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- **Multiplexer**: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- **Shell**: [ZSH](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh)
- **Terminal Emulator**: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

## Currently doing...
Currently, I'm learning GoLang. I love how simple yet powerful it is (just like C).
This is one of my most recent projects:
- **Messaging Service with End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Built a messaging service similar to email, where users can securely send messages to each other using x509 certificates. Source code [here](https://git.olympuslab.net/Uni/CSI-ES-2324/src/branch/main/Projs/PD1).

## Projects
You can find most of my personal projects on my [personal Forgejo instance](https://git.olympuslab.net/afonso):

## University Projects

During my time at university, I've worked on various projects that have helped me grow as a developer. Here are a few highlights:
- **Aurras Audio Processing Program**: Developed a client-server audio file processing program in a university project. More details [here](https://github.com/afonsofrancof/Aurras).
- **Tech Finder Android App**: Created an Android app called Tech Finder for a university assignment. Explore the project [here](https://github.com/afonsofrancof/TechFinder).
- **Markdown to HTML Converter**: Built a converter tool to convert Markdown files to HTML as part of a university project. See the code [here](https://github.com/afonsofrancof/MD-2-HTML).
- **Messaging Service with End-to-End Encryption**: Implemented secure communication protocols to ensure privacy and confidentiality in messaging. See the code [here](https://git.olympuslab.net/Uni/CSI-ES-2324/src/branch/main/Projs/PD1)

Looking forward to collaborating and learning together!
